## Sorting algorithms


Sorting in c is the process of arranging elements either in ascending (or) descending order. 

The term sorting appeared when humans realized the importance of searching quickly.


Type of problem. The next samples establish arrays as banks of counters to illustrate another of their attributes. 
A C structure is introduced, defined, and sorted.

Array class’s built-in BinarySearch() and Sort() methods with simple data types such as
int, double, and string. 
The Sort() method accepts an array parameter and arranges its elements in descending order.

#### What is Sorting?

Sorting in c is the processing of arranging the data in ascending and descending order.
There are several types of sorting in data structures, namely – 
- bubble sort, 
- insertion sort, 
- selection sort,
- bucket sort, 
- heap sort, 
- quick sort,
- radix sort, etc.


The sort in c function in uses a simple inline data type like the one discussed in sorting in c, It refers to the items sorted only 
through its arguments and a few simple operations on the data.


What is sorting? Sorting in c is the process of arranging data into meaningful order so that you can analyze it more effectively.

#### Bubble sorting
Sorting an array in C using the bubble method is simple; we simply step through the array in a for cycle, and within that cycle, we do another cycle; that is, we have two cycles.

In the second cycle (which goes from 0 to the length of the array minus the step of the first cycle) we compare the current element with the next one, and if the current one is larger, we exchange the values.

This is repeated and at the end the array will be sorted.
